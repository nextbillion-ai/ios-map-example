     This method is called after an annotation is selected, before any callout is

     If the return value is `YES`, a callout view is shown when the user taps on an
     annotation, selecting it. The default callout displays the annotation’s title
     and subtitle. You can add accessory views to either end of the callout by

     `-mapView:rightCalloutAccessoryViewForAnnotation:` methods. You can further
     customize the callout’s contents by implementing the
     `-mapView:calloutViewForAnnotation:` method.

     If the return value is `NO`, or if this method is absent from the delegate, or
     if the annotation lacks a title, the annotation will not show a callout even
     when selected.

     In a standard callout view, accessory views contain custom content and are
     positioned on either side of the annotation title text. If an accessory view
     you specify is a descendant of the `UIControl` class, the map view calls this
     method as a convenience whenever the user taps your view. You can use this
     method to respond to taps and perform any actions associated with that control.
     For example, if your control displays additional information about the
     annotation, you could use this method to present a modal panel with that
     information.

     the map view does not call this method. If the annotation has a custom callout
